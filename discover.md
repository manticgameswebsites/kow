## Abyssal Dwarfs

Twisted, evil parodies of their mountain-dwelling brethren. The Abyssal Dwarfs make use of slaves to bolster their numbers, and dark technologies to rain fire and destruction on their foes.

When the hordes of Tragar march forth, the world trembles before them. The sky darkens with the shadows of hundreds of winged creatures, the ground shudders under the march of thousands of slaves and soldiers, and the air shivers with the sound of arcane weaponry and dark sorcery.

## Basileans

In a world beset by evil there is a single beacon of hope for the world of man. Holy crusaders and scourges of the Abyss, the forces of Basilea stride forth from their golden city to strike fear into the hearts of evildoers across the land. Their faith is as strong as their martial prowess, maintained by the Paladin warrior-scholars in their ranks and bolstered by the angelic Elohi that march to battle alongside them.

Whatever the future may hold for Basilea and its people, the Hegemony is the largest and most powerful human nation in the world. It is the only nation to boast a standing army of professional soldiers. Thousands of men-at-arms, disciplined and trained to face any horrors the Abyss may launch at them, standing ready to defend Basilea at any moment. Entire chapel-barracks of noble Paladins devote their lives to battle and prayer in the name of their patron gods. The Hegemony’s countryside is dotted by fortress convents where the Sisterhood train in a style of lightning warfare encounterable by most other armies, and the colleges of the Golden Horn produce more mages trained in the arts of battle magic than anywhere else. 

And all of these soldiers will be needed. To the north and west lay Tragar and the lands of the Abyss, where the Hegemony lays directly in the path of their forces as they try to push into northern Mantica. The destruction of the Dark Ones’ minions are integral to the oaths of the Hegemony’s holy warriors, and Basilea stands guard against Abyss-spawned horrors with no complaint. 

## Dwarfs

Short in stature but as unyielding as the mountains themselves, the Dwarfs are a proud and noble people who attach a great deal of importance to heritage and custom. It is a naïve opponent indeed who does not acknowledge the Dwarf talents for war. 

When a Dwarf Hold goes to war, there are few who can stand against it. Huge artillery pieces and legions of sharpshooters whittle away at the foe from range, before ranks of doughty warriors and frenzied berserkers fall on the remainder and smash them apart. When the Dwarfs go to war, they do so to win.

## Elves

One of the oldest of the civilised races, the Elves have mastered warfare as they have every other pastime to which they turn their minds.

Elves rarely take to the field in great numbers, but when they do their victory is all but assured. Swift cavalry, mercilessly drilled infantry and uncannily accurate artillery combine to wipe their foes from existence in short order.

## Goblins

Most Goblins are far too weaselly for proper fighting, generally taking to the field in a large, poorly armed rabble that has to be kicked toward the enemy. Whereas Orcs are badly disciplined but bold, Goblins are just badly disciplined. Given the chance, they will flee from a fight at the slightest opportunity, and must be tightly controlled by their betters if they are to function as a useful force.

The greater strategists among Orc-kind recognise this and give allow their smaller cousins bows, provided the Goblins stand in front of the Orcs and point the weapons away from them. The bow is the preferred weapon of the Goblin in any case, as they generally feel safer when they can inflict harm on their enemies from a distance, and, should the opportunity arise, and they can get up the courage, it also affords them the opportunity for revenge on their oppressors…

## Forces of the Abyss

The Abyss is a strange other-realm, populated by wicked creatures locked in an eternal battle with each other. Whenever they are directed to fight the outside world, it is a time of woe for all civilised races, for the Abyssals recognise no allies. 

Mass incursions of the forces of the Abyss are thankfully rare, for when they do happen, the suffering is terrible. Pouring forth in waves of demonic creatures on foot and in the air, an Abyssal horde may only ever be stopped at great cost and after much bloodshed.

## Forces of Nature

While the armies of Mantica wage constant war, vying for power in a tumultuous land, they are ever watched from the darkening forests and windswept tors. These secret watchers are the Druids, servants of the Green Lady, and they seek nothing more than true balance between the forces of light and darkness. When the scales tip too far in favour of good or evil, the Druids awaken their own armies – fey spirits, vengeful elementals and ferocious beasts – and march to restore order to the land. No leafy grove or befrosted tundra can provide sanctuary from the Forces of Nature; to battle them is to battle the world of Mantica itself.

## Ogres

Ogres are mercenaries, happy to sell their skills to the highest bidder. Huge, powerful creatures that might almost have been purpose bred for war, few races can match them for sheer belligerent power and endurance, and many a war has been won by the side that hired the most.

If a kingdom is wealthy enough to hire an Ogre horde, then its security and supremacy over its neighbours may generally be assured. Ogres make war the way that other races conduct trade – it is simply a way of life to them, a means to an end. It is not unheard of for both sides in a battle or war to employ Ogres, and there are no grudges between the different sides afterward – business is business after all.

## Orcs

Orcs live for war in a quite literal sense, having been bred for that very purpose by the machinations of an evil god. Over the centuries, they have developed neither culture nor civilisation, busy as they are locked in eternal battle with anything in reach, including each other. 

Orcs thankfully spend so much time fighting each other that they rarely gather in enough force to truly threaten the civilised races of the world. When such a gathering does occur though, it is nigh unstoppable, petering out only when its soldiers exhaust themselves in the constant fighting, or else simply turn on each other in a quiet moment between battles.

## Undead

The dead do not rest easy, for there are those who would use them as macabre puppets to fulfil their own mortal ends. Skeletal foot troops and cavalry shamble onwards in a relentless tide, overwhelming any who stand in their path. 

Even the bravest of men will blanch in terror at the sight of an Undead horde. Legions of foulness advance in horrifying silence, destroying all that they see before them without mercy or restraint. And then, the greatest horror of all, the recently dead rise up on the invisible strings of their necromantic masters to turn on those they called friends and comrades.
