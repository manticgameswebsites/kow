## It's Time For War (The Game)

Kings of War is the game of fantasy battles fought between mighty
armies. Build and collect an army of miniatures and take part in epic
conflicts and legendary battles across a fantasy realm. Its
fast-paced, competitive rules make the game ideal for massed battles
between hundreds of troops - and with Mantic's range, it's possible to
do just that without breaking the bank!

## Build Big Armies, Play Epic Battles

Mighty armies of infantry and cavalry supported by monsters,
magic-casters and mighty heroes is the name of the game. The Kings of
War miniatures range and game finally lets you build big armies and
battle with them on the tabletop. Which army will you choose?
