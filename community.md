One of the most wonderful things about Mantic is all the fantastic and fanatical fans who absolutely love the fun and excitement that games such as Kings of War give them.

These awesome people that make up the Mantic Community are always willing to share advice or tips, writing articles and battle reports telling of their latest glorious victory or unlucky defeat, and also producing pictures of wonderfully painted miniatures that really inspire fellow hobbyists. They can be found in gaming clubs, stores and conventions around the world and are great opponents to talk to and to play against.
